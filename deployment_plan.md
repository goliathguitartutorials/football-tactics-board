# Football Tactics Board - Deployment Plan

## Project Overview
The project is a Football Tactics Board web application built with:
- React (v19)
- Vite (v6.2.0)
- React Konva for canvas-based drawing

The app allows users to:
- Place and manipulate players on a football pitch
- Draw various shapes (lines, arrows, circles)
- Use different colors
- Save and load board states
- Set player numbers
- Apply formations

## Current Status
- All configuration changes for GitHub Pages deployment have been completed ✅
- Application builds successfully with correct paths ✅
- Preview of the production build works locally ✅
- GitHub Actions workflow has been created ✅

## What's Been Done

### 1. Configure Vite for GitHub Pages ✅

We've updated the Vite configuration to properly handle GitHub Pages deployment:

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/football-tactics-board/', // Base path for GitHub Pages deployment
})
```

### 2. Update Asset References ✅

We've updated the asset references in index.html to work correctly in the deployed environment:

```html
<!-- From -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />

<!-- To -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="./vite.svg" />
```

### 3. Create GitHub Actions Workflow ✅

We've created a workflow file to automate the build and deployment process:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          folder: dist
          branch: gh-pages
```

### 4. Update README ✅

We've updated the README.md with project information and deployment instructions.

### 5. Testing ✅

We've confirmed that the build process works correctly locally:
- Running `npm run build` successfully creates a build with the correct base path
- Assets in the built files reference the correct paths with the `/football-tactics-board/` prefix
- The local preview (`npm run preview`) shows the app correctly with the base path

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. On GitHub.com:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
   - Under "Build and deployment" > "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - This will tell GitHub to use your workflow file for deployment

3. After pushing the changes, GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build your project
   - Deploy it to the gh-pages branch
   - Make it available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/football-tactics-board/`

4. Verify the deployment by visiting the URL and checking that all functionality works correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for any build or deployment errors
2. Verify that the base URL in vite.config.js matches your repository name exactly
3. Make sure GitHub Pages is correctly configured in your repository settings
4. Test locally with `npm run build` and `npm run preview` to confirm the build works on your machine

## Fallback Options

If you continue to have issues with GitHub Pages:

1. Consider deploying to Netlify or Vercel, which have excellent support for Vite applications
2. Both platforms offer free hosting and automatic deployments from GitHub

Good luck with your deployment! The project is now properly configured for GitHub Pages and should deploy successfully.
